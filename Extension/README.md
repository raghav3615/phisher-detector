PhishGuard is a **real-time phishing link detection** Chrome extension designed to enhance online security by identifying malicious URLs. It cross-checks websites against the **Google Safe Browsing API** and the **PhishTank phishing database**, providing instant feedback to users about potential threats.  

## ✨ Features  
✔ **Real-time URL Monitoring** – Automatically checks visited websites for phishing, malware, and other threats.  
✔ **Google Safe Browsing Integration** – Leverages Google's security database for enhanced threat detection.  
✔ **PhishTank Data Lookup** – Fetches the latest phishing URLs every hour for accurate detection.  
✔ **Visual Alerts** – Displays a badge (✔ for safe, ⚠️ for unsafe) on the extension icon for quick user awareness.  
✔ **Manual URL Check** – Users can manually verify links via messaging.  

## 🚀 How It Works  
1. **URL Monitoring:** The extension listens for URL updates in active tabs.  
2. **Threat Analysis:** It queries Google Safe Browsing and PhishTank databases to determine URL safety.  
3. **User Notification:** If a threat is detected, the extension updates its badge and stores the result locally.  
4. **Automatic Updates:** PhishTank data refreshes every hour for up-to-date protection.
